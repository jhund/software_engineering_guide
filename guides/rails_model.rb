# This style guide applies to a **Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord Model** class. It is part of Jo Hund's
# [Style Guide collection](http://github.com/jhund/styleguide).
#
# This convention puts the most important information about a model at the top.

#
class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
  

  # **Include other modules**: They add new behavior to the model. We want to know about
  # this right away.
  include Canable::Permissions
  
  # **Rails macros**: They, too add implicit behavior to our model.
  acts_as_list
  default_scope order("name ASC")
    
  # **ActiveRecord callbacks**: They add important behavior to our model.
  #
  # It's also important to specify callbacks before associations in order for inheritance to work
  # for the callback queues. Otherwise, you might trigger the loading of a child before the parent
  # has registered the callbacks and they wonâ€™t be inherited. (From Rails' ActiveRecord::Callbacks
  # documentation)
  # 
  # * Sort the callbacks as required by model logic and add a comment indicating why a callback's
  #   position is important.
  before_create :set_start_date # no dependencies, do this first
  before_save :update_duration # after set_start_date so we can use start date for calculation
  
  # **ActiveRecord associations**: They tell us how this model interacts with other models.
  # 
  # * Sort the associations alphabetically, including the macro. Helps with detecting duplicates and
  #   finding them.
  # * Never go over 100 characters per line.
  # * Prefer has_many :through over has_and_belongs_to_many
  # * Always spell out the :dependent option explicitly where it applies to prove that you have
  #   thought about it.
  # * Always specify the :inverse_of option on associations.
  #   Helps eliminating some strange bugs when traversing the object graph in-memory and making changes.
  #   Except on :as, :through and :polymorphic associations. Doesn't work on those.
  belongs_to :client, :inverse_of => :projects
  has_many :collaborators, :dependent => :nullify, :inverse_of => :project
  has_many :todos, :order => "position ASC", :dependent => :destroy, :inverse_of => :project
  has_many :persons_responsible,
    :through => :collaborators,
    :uniq => true,
    :source => :person,
    :order => "persons.email ASC"

  # **Validations**
  validates_presence_of :name
  
  # **Scopes** (formerly known as named_scopes)
  #
  # * Sort scopes alphabetically
  # * Never go over 100 characters per line.
  # * For complex scopes, put each element on a new line, put . on previous line to make
  #   multi-line unambiguous for parser
  scope :active, where(:state => "active")
  scope :sorted_by lambda { |sort_key|
    case sort_key

  # **Miscellaneous Declarations**:
  #
  # * state_machine
  # * delegation
  #
  attr_protected :client_id
  alias_method ...
  # I prefer the demeter ruby extension over Rails' delegate for delegation.
  demeter :client_name, :to => :client, :using => :name
  
  # **Class Methods**
  #
  # I prefer the `def self.method_name` form. Shows the class context when looking at the method in isolation
  # (e.g. as part of search results or symbol search in editor)
  def self.class_method_1
  end
  
  def self.class_method_2
  end
  
  # **Instance Methods**
  #
  def instance_method_1(arg1)

  end
  
  # **Permissions**
  #
  # Permissions are all grouped together (both class and instance methods)

    actor.is_admin?

  def updatable_by?(actor)
    owned_by?(actor)

    actor == person
  end
  
  # **Protected Methods**: The `protected` keyword is not indented.
protected

  def protected_method

  # **Private Methods**: The `private` keyword is not indented.
