Jo Hund's Style Guide for AJAX Patterns
=======================================

This style guide applies to **AJAX Patterns**. It is part of Jo Hund's
[Style Guide collection](http://github.com/jhund/styleguide).

Areas to cover:

* when updating content, where is the dom_id to identify the container? Is it part of the partial
  that's being sent over the wire? In other words replaceWith vs. replaceHtml. A convention here
  would be useful.
