Jo Hund's Guide for AJAX Patterns
=================================

This guide applies to **AJAX Patterns**. It is part of Jo Hund's
[Software Engineering Guide](http://github.com/jhund/software_engineering_guide).

Areas to cover:

* when updating content, where is the dom_id to identify the container? Is it part of the partial
  that's being sent over the wire? In other words replaceWith vs. replaceHtml. A convention here
  would be useful.
